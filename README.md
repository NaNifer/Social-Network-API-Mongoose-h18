## Overview

MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Social networking platforms use several technologies in their full-stack applications to build and structure their API's.

### The challenge

The Social Network API in Mongoose challenge is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. This app uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, and the native JavaScript Date object to format timestamps.

### User Story

```md
AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```

## Acknowledgments

This is where you can give a hat tip to anyone who helped you out on this project. Perhaps you worked in a team or got some inspiration from someone else's solution. This is the perfect place to give them some credit.

A huge shout out to [nullaus](https://github.com/nullaus) who was my quick dial on all the random questions about JS, and taught me that the arguments of functions could call on variables inside of other functions.
